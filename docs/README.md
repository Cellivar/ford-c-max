# Documents and Sources

These folders contain documents from various sources with various levels of authority. I've found them to be incredibly useful when learning about how my vehicle functions.

## Official Sources

Ford published a number of official sources of information. Anything that was obviously made public I've copied to [the Ford folder](/docs//ford/README.md). I've also listed other links of interest there.

Additionally the US Department of Energy [released some documents](/docs//us_doe/README.md).

## Unofficial Sources

### YouTube

Weber State University's Department of Automotive Technology has an _excellent_ channel doing deep dives into the systems within vehicles. Professor John D. Kelly walks through the history, components, and function of the Ford Fusion Hybrid systems. Most of these concepts translate directly over to the C-Max, and the main difference with the Energi model he doesn't cover is the charging system on the Energi model.
