The TCU is the cellular modem in the Energi vehicles responsible for making MyFord Mobile and Ford Pass work. It communicates over the cell network to report vehicle information, and the cell network can push configuration to the vehicle for things like charging times and preferences.

## Hardware Revisions

My 2013 C-Max was originally shipped with a 2G modem on the AT&T network. In 2016 a recall was run to upgrade these as the 2G networks were being shut down. In Ford's infinite cost-cutting wisdom they installed 3G modems.

In 2022 Ford again faced the issue that the 3G networks were being shut down, however this time they issued a _customer support program_ instead of a full recall. This upgraded to a 4G modem, but for C-Max owners it was a tiny fraction who got it for free. Everyone else got to pay.

These hardware revisions had fairly significant changes, so are broken out into separate subpages:

* [2G Modem](./TCU_2G.md)
* [3G Modem](./TCU_3G.md)
* [4G Modem](./TCU_4G.md)
