The OCS is responsible for determining what the occupants of the vehicle are and how to react to safely manage the occupants in a crash. In a C-Max this is mostly responsible for determining if the passenger seat is empty, has an adult in it, or has a child or car seat that _should not_ have an airbag deployed.

When you have a heavy backpack sitting in the front passenger seat and the "PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF" light turns on that's the OCS at work deciding it's safer that the backpack not get punched with an airbag.

## AsBuilt Configuration

The OCS has no AsBuilt configuration.
