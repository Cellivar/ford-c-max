The GPSM module is present on 2013-2015 model year vehicles prior to [the Sync 3 APIM transition](/systems/modules/APIM_SYNC3.md). This module is located behind the IPC under the dash for a good view of the overhead sky.

On a [Sync 2 system](/systems/modules/APIM_SYNC2.md) this provided GPS information to the [IPS](/systems/modules/IPC.md), the  and the APIM for turn-by-turn, emergency call location, compass heading, and other software integrations. After [a Sync 3 retrofit](/mods/sync_3_retrofit.md) the module is still used by the old IPC for the compass display.

## AsBuilt

The DE8T-19H463-AE has one AsBuilt block with 4 bytes. I don't know what they control.
