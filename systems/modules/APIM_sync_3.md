# Accessory Protocol Interface Module - Sync 3

The Ford Sync 3 touchscreen, computer, and APIM sandwich was used across many different models of vehicles for many years. As a result there is a wide swath of information about the hardware and software, including long lists of the various physical hardware combinations.

TODO: Link to all of those and explain them!

My Sync 3 unit is out of a 2016 Escape, making it a fairly early APIM model which causes a few limitations.

## AsBuilt

I'm not going to bother rewriting [CyanLab's excellent AsBuilt database](https://cyanlabs.net/asbuilt-db/sync3-apim/) for Sync 3, go check them out and chip them a few bucks in their donation jar for their efforts.
