# Accessory Protocol Interface Module - Sync 2

Go [watch this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrvmzxIJOXw) about why My Ford Touch was a disaster. The short version is that Ford took Microsoft off the hardware integration, allowed a no-name no-experience contracting company to slap it together, and didn't pay too close attention to what they were doing. The contractor used Adobe Air for the system UI and used a woefully underpowered CPU to run the entire thing. Microsoft was called in after the vehicles shipped to do damage control, while Ford was burned hard enough to jump ship to QNX for Sync 3.

## AsBuilt

I'm not going to bother rewriting [CyanLab's excellent AsBuilt database](https://cyanlabs.net/asbuilt-db/sync2-apim/) for Sync 2, go check them out and chip them a few bucks in their donation jar for their efforts.
