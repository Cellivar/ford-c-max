The SASM, as the name implies, determines the angle of the steering wheel for steering related controls. This works with the PSCM to manage where you turn and what kind of force is applied to help you turn. It also works with the APIM during Active Park Assist. On other vehicles this module also participates in things like Active Lane Keeping and other things C-Maxes don't have.

## AsBuilt Configuration

The SASM has no AsBuilt configuration.
