The DC/DC convert replaces the traditional alternator in ICE vehicles. The C-Max doesn't have an alternator, it has [two motor/generators that can either drive the vehicle forward or generate power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZf_BUuW5Qg) depending on what the vehicle is doing.

Instead of an alternator the Ford hybrids have a module that steps down the high voltage power to 12V and supplies that power to the rest of the vehicle.

[Weber Auto has an excellent video walking through how the Ford Hybrid systems work here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmDpNr1PdMk).
