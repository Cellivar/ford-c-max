# Parking Aid Module

Two part number series:

* -A_ modules (AA through AJ): Rear PDC only
* -B_ modules (BA through BH): Full SAPP with front and rear PDC

Attempting to enable SAPP with a -A series unit will not work, generates DTCs in the PSCM and the PAM and breaks rear PDC. Generates warning messages in the IPC.
