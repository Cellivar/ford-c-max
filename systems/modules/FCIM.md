The FCIM is the HVAC control module located below the touchscreen vents. Note that this does not include the two sets of buttons below the HVAC controls, which are not a module, just additional buttons that go to other modules.

The FCIM changed significantly in the 2016 facelift and is a totally different part number (that I don't have at time of writing). The modules are not directly drop-in compatible as they changed where the heated seats are managed. In the 2013-2015 vehicles there are little rollers on either side of the 12V power point in the center console between the seats. 2016+ vehicles moved the heated seats to CANBUS control, and the FCIM and APIM both control that.

The FCIM is only present in 8" touchscreen C-Maxes with Sync 2 or Sync 3, if you had the 4" Sync 1 system you have [an FCDIM instead](./FCDIM.md).

## AsBuilt Configuration

The FCIM has no AsBuilt configuration.
