# Low-voltage battery alternatives

In the year 2013 we were still bashing rocks together to figure out how to make electric vehicles work and [hadn't figured it out yet](https://insideevs.com/news/319863/focus-electric-recalled-as-ford-finally-reacts-to-the-stop-safely-now-power-loss-problem/). Ford, uninterested in rocking the boat too much, took the safe route of using a basic lead-acid battery for the 12V system.

It's been more than a decade since then and new options are on the market. Is it worth spending hundreds of dollars more on alternate battery types?

## No not really

TODO: Links and stuff

As of writing (2023-05-09) all of the alternate battery chemistries are _at least_ 2x as expensive as the standard OEM battery ($150 from Ford).

Non-lead acid battery advantages include:

* Weight savings (>60% lighter!)
* Capacity increase (double or more!)
* Fancy features like bluetooth and reserve cutouts

And none of these seemed compelling for my 10 year old car. I didn't feel like $450 for a reputable brand's _entry level battery option_ was a reasonable price to pay for these features. This is before mentioning that the BMS would no doubt cause all kinds of weirdness trying to charge and discharge an LFP or Li-Ion battery pack.

This is before mentioning the annoying part: Most of these alternate batteries _do not come in the right size for a C-Max_. The Group 67R battery size is weirdly short, so most of the alternate batteries available would be a tight fit into the sames space as the OEM battery.
