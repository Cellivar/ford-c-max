# Fuses, Breakers, and Relays

There is one high-amp fuse attached to the power distribution box and one to the battery terminal as well. These are hard to replace if they blow, and usually indicate something terrible has happened somewhere else.

## Power Distribution Box (Engine fuse box)

Open the hood, on the driver's side. There's a lever at the back to open it.
