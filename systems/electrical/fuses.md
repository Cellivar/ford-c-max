# Fuses, Breakers, and Relays

There is one high-amp fuse attached to the power distribution box and one to the battery terminal as well. These are hard to replace if they blow, and usually indicate something terrible has happened somewhere else.

## Power Distribution Box (Engine fuse box)

Open the hood, on the driver's side. There's a lever at the back to open it.

## Notes

* Pull luggage panel fuse 1 if the hands-free liftgate annoys you too much.
* Fuse 61 is the lighter socket and 110V inverter supply, don't overload the 20A or it'll pop.
* Fuse 67 is commonly pulled to reset the TCU when it misbehaves.

If your vehicle didn't come with a feature (powered liftgate, rear view camera, etc) then the fuse locations will not only be missing the fuses _but they will also be missing the connector for the fuse too_. For the trunk fuse panel you can fix this yourself.

1. Buy a used trunk fuse panel for a 2013-2018 Escape, Focus, Fiesta, or C-Max.
2. Take it apart, pulling out the wires and connectors and noting from whence they came.
3. Disconnect the battery from your car.
4. Take your own trunk fuse panel apart, carefully, and insert the fuse connectors you need.

This lets you populate fuses in the OEM manner, reducing your own future confusion!
