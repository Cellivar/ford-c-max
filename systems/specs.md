# C-Max Specifications

For the most part, the C-Max didn't change much over the history of the vehicle's production. While there were some changes over the years the specs of the vehicle mostly stayed consistent.

This lists the specs as detailed by Ford, though some of the numbers were revised (such as the MPG range) after initial release.

Values for Energi models are omitted if they are the same as the FHEV model.
