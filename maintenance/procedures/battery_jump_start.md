# Jump starting a C-Max

1. Open the hood, secure it with the latch.
2. Find the positive jump terminal next to the underhood fuse box, on the far right side of the bay, near the hinge. It should have a red cap with a + symbol on it.
3. Find the negative jump terminal below the positive terminal, it is a rod that sticks up next to the orange high voltage cables and may be hard to see at first.
    * The location is in the driver's manual.
    * I ignore this and just clip onto the metal housing of the inverter box instead.
4. Attach the clips in the order according to how you're jumping below.
5. Once the car is powered sufficiently get in and turn it on.

Once the car is "on" you can disconnect everything, you do not need to force the engine to start.

## Jumping with a jump pack

When jumping with a jump pack I find it more convenient to

1. Disconnect the clips from the pack.
2. Connect the red and black clips to the C-Max.
3. Connect the clip's wires into the pack in one smooth motion.
4. Start the car.

I do this regularly when my car is throwing fits and have not had issues with the procedure.

## Jumping with another car

Remember to start with RED TO DEAD. Even though the 12V battery isn't under the hood of the C-Max it's good to always be safe.

1. Connect the RED lead to the C-Max positive jump terminal.
2. Connect the other RED lead to the DONOR car.
3. Connect the BLACK lead to the DONOR car.
4. Connect the other BLACK lead to the C-Max negative jump terminal.
5. Do not rev the donor. Start the C-Max normally.

## Using the C-Max to jump another car

DO NOT.

The DC-DC converter for the C-Max was not designed for the amp draw that an ICE car can demand at startup. Trying to use a C-Max to jump another car is explicitly disallowed in the manual.

THIS CAN DAMAGE THE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE DC-DC CONVERTER.

### Using the C-Max to jump another C-Max

I need to find a willing test participant to give this a go, but in theory this particular operation would be safe.

If anyone is ever in this situation, let me know how it goes!
