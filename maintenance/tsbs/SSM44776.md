# SSM 44776 - 2013-2014 C-Max, 2013-2015 Fusion HEV/PHEV and MKZ HEV, or 2012-2014 Focus BEV - Powertrain Modules Coordinated Flash - Service Tip

* Effective Oct 20 2014

2013-2014 C-Max, 2013-2015 Fusion HEV/PHEV and MKZ HEV, and 2012-2014 Focus BEV require a coordinated flash when performing module programming for the ABS, BECM, PCM, SOBDM, or TCM.

When module programming is initiated for any of these modules, the IDS will check for software updates for the ABS, BECM, PCM, SOBDM, and the TCM and will automatically install updates to each module that is not already at the latest level. If the coordinated flash is interrupted undesired vehicle operation may result.

If the ABS module is programmed during the coordinated flash, DTC C1018 may be present after programming has completed, and the Multi-Calibration Routine must be performed. The Multi-Calibration Routine is found in IDS by selecting Toolbox - Chassis - Braking – Service Routine – Multi-Calibration.

## Notes

This implies these modules have firmware that is tested and expected to work together, and having the firmware be out of sync on them can cause problems with the vehicle. Trying to flash these modules independently in FORScan may result in issues, and it's difficult to tell what calibration level each one of them should be at together.

Some research into which approved calibration levels are designed to work together would be beneficial here.
