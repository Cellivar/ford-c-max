# Technical Service Bulletins and Special Service Messages

These are the documents for the recalls and service information for the C-Max vehicles. These are published by Ford and available from the NHST as well.

*TSB*s, or Technical Service Bulletins, are generally the information associated with a recall. They may include technical details as to how to fix the problem.

Some TSBs may have additonal _supplements_ released under the same number. These add or change instructions and details, and the latest supplement is what should be placed here.

*SSM*s, or Special Service Messages, generally contain an explanation of behavior or known issues and how to resolve them. They are usually not associated with a recall, and are usually just "Yeah this is expected behavior, tell the customer to RFTM." Sometimes they're useful tidbits related to how to work on the car.
