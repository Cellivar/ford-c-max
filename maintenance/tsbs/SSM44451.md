# SSM 44451 Updated PC/ED Cooling Fan Diagnostics in Pin Point Test KF

Pin Point Test (PPT) KF in the Powertrain Control/Emissions Diagnostic (PC/ED) manual has recently been updated to reflect the improved cooling fan circuit testing.

When servicing some 2013-2014 vehicles that are experiencing a lack of air conditioning, overheat, or a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) with a P0480 or P0481 in the Powertrain Control Module (PCM), the cooling fan diagnostics have been improved to better identify concerns related to the circuits and relays.

Please be sure that PPT KF is carefully followed, as this could aid in prevent unnecessary cooling fan replacement.

## Notes

This seems to imply the vehicle cooling fan is less likely to be a culprit in these problems than initial testing showed. Be cautious when investigating issues with aircon and overheats, the fan may not be the issue.
