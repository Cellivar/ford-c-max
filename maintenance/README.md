# Maintenance and Operating Procedures

General documentation about owning and operating an increasingly high mileage C-Max.

## Procedures

* [Jump starting a C-Max](./procedures/battery_jump_start.md)
* [Resetting the BMS after installing a new battery](./procedures/bms_battery_age_reset.md)

## TSBs

For my benefit I've been collecting all of the Technical Service Bulletin and Special Service notifications Ford put out about the C-Max. [I've got a collection here](./tsbs/README.md) as backup because they're scattered about the internet.
