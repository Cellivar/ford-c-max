# ford-c-max

I own a 2013 Ford C-Max Energi Plug-In Hybrid. It's weird and I love it. These are some notes about it.

* [Systems and Information](/systems/README.md)
* [Maintenance Procedures](/maintenance/README.md)
* [Ford Documentation](/docs/ford/README.md)
* [Other tidbits](/other)

I welcome contributions with open arms, if anyone would like to add to these notes please get in touch! You're welcome submit suggestions to edit pages, or just [open a new issue](https://github.com/Cellivar/ford-c-max/issues/new/choose) to paste a link or otherwise tell me about something new. I'll happily take it and incorporate it into these documents.
