# C-Max Accessories

Ford and other OEMs created a number of accessories for the C-Max vehicles. This list is for the ones officially designed just for the C-Max or the C-Max, Fusion, and Ford Focus Electric series, things that were used in many Ford vehicles of the era are omitted.

## Ford Accessories

Official accessories that showed up in the accessories catalogs. Many are now discontinued.

If anyone ever has a lead on the lighted door sills I want them.

### Mats

Alternate floor mats from Ford to replace the ones wearing out in your car.

| Part Number | Name | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| DM5Z-5813300-AA | All-weather floor mats | Black, 4-piece |
| DM5Z-5413300-AA | Carpeted floor mats | Medium Stone (tan/beige), 4-piece |

| DM5Z-6111600-AA | Cargo Area Protector mat | Black, for Hybrid |
| DM5Z-6111600-BA | Cargo Area Protector mat | Black, for Energi |

### Remote Start and Security

The Energi comes with the 5-button "Intelligent Access Key", the base model Hybrid came without remote start.

#### 2013-2015

* Bidirectional with feedback meant the button made a noise and blinked when the car started.
* With PEPS means the unit is compatible with push-button start vehicles.

| Part number | W/Feedback | Compatible with push-button start | Name |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- | ---- |
| CM5Z-19G364-E | ❌ | ✅ | Series 100 |
| CM5Z-19G364-A | ❌ | ❌ | Series 100 |
| CM5Z-19G364-F | ✅ | ✅ | Bidirectional |
| CM5Z-19G364-B | ✅ | ❌ | Bidirectional |

The security module is `DM5Z-19A361-B` and is apparently only for vehicles with factory remote start (IAK??) and uses the factory fob.

#### 2016-2017

The 2016 Sync 3 and CGEA upgrades meant Ford could start re-using equipment from other vehicles easier. This resulted in a modular system, where you could choose what features to mix together.

Supposedly this equipment is plug=and-play, or requires some FORScan programming. I can't find good details.

One of the additions for only the 2016-2017 range was the Ford Remote Access module and app, this was an alternative to MyFord Mobile (which became Ford Pass) that allowed non-Energi models to use an app to lock, unlock, and remote start via a 3G modem. It did not receive a 4G upgrade route and shut down in 2020.

#### 2018

The 2018 year only includes the Hybrid as the Energi model was discontinued by then. The security module appears physically different with a different harness.

### Roof racks

Thule was the 3rd party roof rack system provider. I've heard tell that other manufacturers also made compatible systems but can't find much about them.

They kill aero performance so don't leave them on if you're not using them. Seriously it's like 4 MPG or so.

| Part Number | Name |
| - | - |
| VDM5Z-7855100-A | Roof Rack and Crossbar System, needed for other carriers |
| VAT4Z-7855100-K | Bike Carrier, one per bike, up to two. |

## Other Manufacturers

Not to be left out other manufacturers produced accessories for the C-Max as well, though didn't make the cut into Ford's catalog.

### Mats

#### Husy Liners

Husky makes custom-fit floor mat replacements. I picked up a set of [their X-Act Contour](https://www.huskyliners.com/Floor-Mats-Floor-Liners/2013/ford/c-max) liners in 2015 and they're still working well and looking fresh in my car. Every so often a friend apologizes for muddy shoes and I'm once more thankful I bothered with the purchase. Every time I bother to scrub them clean they go back to looking brand new.
