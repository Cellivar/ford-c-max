# FORScan

[FORScan](https://forscan.org/) is a tool for reading the proprietary Ford data in your Ford vehicle. It also works for Mercury, Lincoln, and some ~Ford fooling itself~ Mazda vehicles.

It is worth its weight in gold. The developers are knowledgable and helpful so long as you do your own research first. Spend the money on [the extended license if you need it for something](https://forscan.org/comparsion.html), it's worth every penny.

They also have a mobile app which is, again worth it if you need to regularly check your car via your phone.

FORScan is the primary reason I will strongly consider Ford vehicles before I consider other vehicles for future purchases.

## Adapters

Don't mess around, just shell out the money for [the OBDLink EX](https://www.obdlink.com/products/obdlink-ex/?ref=forscan) USB adapter. It's worth every penny of frustration I ever had with cheaper adapters when I was trying to save twenty bucks. This supports all of the programming operations I've ever wanted to perform on my car and works fantastic with FORScan. Just buy it, seriously, don't think about it, you will spend more on lost 10mm sockets in your lifetime.

If you want bluetooth OBDLink also makes [a bluetooth adapter](https://www.obdlink.com/products/obdlink-mxp/?ref=forscan) that is also worth the money. It's quite a bit steeper though, and I have the previous non-Plus version. It's nice for using the FORScan Android app, but I don't trust bluetooth for important tasks like flashing modules anyway. If you're thinking about saving money just buy the USB version and get a plug adapter for your phone.
